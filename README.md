# Master Thesis Project

This repository contains the data and python script used to create the figures in for my master's thesis at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, 
Graduate Program in Geophysics. \
The name of the thesis is: \
Inter-event times of subduction-thrust seismicity in Northern Chile. Do they reveal sings of Earthquake Synchronisation?

# Explanations
The module IET Analysis y contains all functions to load and select data, to calculate
and visualise inter-event times, and to create different types of maps and histograms presented in my master's thesis. 
The script Driver Plots Masterthesis can be run to create most of the figures presented in my thesis, based on the functions in IET Analysis.
